# Pragma Hackathon Template 🧪

This repository serves as a template for building with Pragma during the Pragma Cairo 1 hackathon.

> After deploying a contract, you need to call the initializer function (which can be called only one time per value set).

## Getting Started 🚀

You can find all the addresses to interact with in the pragma [documentation](https://docs.pragmaoracle.com/docs/starknet/data-feeds/consuming-data).

## Supported Assets 📈

You can find the list of supported assets [here](https://docs.pragmaoracle.com/docs/starknet/data-feeds/supported-assets) or on the [pragma homepage](https://pragmaoracle.com/).

## WARNING ⚠️

The current Pragma documentation is still for Cairo 0, however you can still
interact with Cairo 0 contracts from Cairo 1 contracts.
